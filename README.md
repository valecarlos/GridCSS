# GridCSS
Creating a Grid view using CSS atributes, which is responsive on window resize.

Taking advantage of the CSS media queries to resize and adjust li elements in order to show a responsive image grid.

This idea is to show an image or project gallery with hover effects (using figure and figcaption elements) and with an addded js effect on load to give it a smooth introduction.
